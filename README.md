# Design Patterns Written In Java

## Summary of Creational Patterns

 - The Factory Pattern is used to choose and return an instance of a class from a number of similar classes based on data you provide to the factory.  
 - The Abstract Factory Pattern is used to return one of several groups of classes. In some cases it actually returns a Factory for that group of classes.  
 - The Builder Pattern assembles a number of objects to make a new object, based on the data with which it is presented. Frequently, the choice of which way the objects are assembled is achieved using a Factory.  
 - The Prototype Pattern copies or clones an existing class rather than creating a new instance when creating new instances is more expensive.  
 - The Singleton Pattern is a pattern that insures there is one and only one instance of an object, and that it is possible to obtain global access to that one instance.
